I was really confused by the submission format, you said no images, 
but the entire point of my study is that it explores the effects of different 
sizes of data sets. and if all you have is 30 images, then how will you get
to the conclusion that follows my report. (or do you just run your photos through it
to make sure it functions, and you dont actually care about the results?)

- i have left all my files in there, you can just delete the 2 datasets and the saved models.




Changes to make to the System for functionality:

tensor, keras, os, matplotlib, numpy are required




For testing purposes:
	- Uncomment Line 150 (there is also a commented guide)

For Training: 
if you want to use small dataset: 

	- change line 108 parameter with 'data_dir_small'
	- change String in line 90 to "SmallSavedModel"
	- change String in line 129 to "SmallSavedModel"
if you want to use Large dataset:

	- change line 108 parameter with 'data_dir_large'
	- change String in line 90 to "LargeSavedModel"
	- change String in line 129 to "LargeSavedModel"

alternatively, if you have your own folder of images that will be used for training:
	
	- add directory to String in line 105
	- change line 108 parameter with 'data_set'


if the images you want to test with are png: 
	- on line 11, add png to that list of extentions 

if you want to test without training:
	- comment out line108
	- uncomment line 150
